# Backlog

Ordered by priority; the founder reorders. Grammar in TEAM.md.

## FR-1 · pm · BRIEF.md v0 to v0.1: sharpen questions and hypotheses
- state: in-progress
- gated: no
- why: there is no constitution; every other item needs one to justify itself
- dod:
  - each open question in BRIEF.md has an owner and a concrete way it gets answered
  - the June 2026 brief is read and its claims are listed as hypotheses, not facts
  - failure case: a hypothesis we cannot test within a month is marked "parked", not deleted or silently believed
- note: v0.1 shipped (BRIEF.md). Dod bullet 2 is partly blocked — `PRODUCT_BRIEF.md` is not present in this repo or reachable from the routine's environment, so its claims could not be read directly; BRIEF.md now says so explicitly and lists only reconstructed, clearly-unverified hypotheses. Closing this fully needs the founder to add the source document to the repo.

## FR-2 · pm · Competitive teardown of call-sheet tools
- state: ready
- gated: no
- why: we must know what an AD would have to give up to switch
- dod:
  - docs/research/competitive-teardown.md covers StudioBinder, Yamdu, SetHero, Movie Magic Scheduling, Croogloo
  - for each: how a call sheet is built, revised, distributed, viewed offline; pricing; who the buyer is
  - every claim cites the vendor page or docs it came from, with the date checked
  - failure case: a tool whose behaviour cannot be verified from public sources is marked "unverified", not guessed

## FR-3 · pm · Customer discovery plan: five Prague interviews
- state: ready
- gated: partial
- why: Q1 to Q4 in BRIEF.md can only be answered by the people who make call sheets
- dod:
  - docs/research/discovery-plan.md names the target roles (1st AD, 2nd AD, production coordinator), a 30-minute script, and a note-taking template
  - a draft invitation email exists as text; sending it is an INBOX item, not done by the routine
  - failure case: if fewer than five candidates can be named from the founder's network, the plan says how to find the rest (film schools, FAMU, production listings) instead of shrinking the sample

## FR-4 · tech-lead · ADR-001: stack of the skeleton
- state: ready
- gated: no
- why: the restart from Next.js + Supabase to FastAPI + vanilla PWA must be a recorded decision, not an accident
- dod:
  - docs/adr/ADR-001-stack.md states the options (keep old repo, this skeleton, hybrid), the choice, and the consequences
  - it lists what the old repo had that this one lacks (auth, SSO scaffold, budget, scheduling) and when each would be ported
  - failure case: if a hard requirement in BRIEF.md later contradicts the choice, the ADR names the trigger to revisit rather than being rewritten

## FR-5 · tech-lead · Security and QA gate checklist
- state: ready
- gated: no
- why: gates exist as roles in TEAM.md but not as a checklist anyone can run
- dod:
  - docs/gates/pre-merge-checklist.md with security items (secrets, auth on every non-public route, input validation, dependency pins) and QA items (tests for the change, failure case covered, CI green)
  - the PR template references it
  - failure case: a PR that skips the checklist is visible as such in the template, not silently merged

## FR-6 · marketing · Positioning draft
- state: blocked
- gated: no
- why: outreach and landing need one sentence of positioning that survives contact with an AD
- dod:
  - docs/marketing/positioning.md with alternatives considered and the chosen one, grounded in FR-1 and FR-2 findings
  - blocked until FR-1 and FR-2 are done
  - failure case: if FR-2 shows a competitor already owns the chosen position, the draft says so and proposes another, rather than ignoring it

## FR-7 · security · Fix three findings from the founding commit review
- state: ready
- gated: no
- why: an automated security review of commit 81e9fc4 found a hardcoded dev token default in backend/app/config.py, stored XSS in frontend/index.html (API data rendered via innerHTML without escaping), and forgeable audit fields in backend/app/services/call_sheets.py
- dod:
  - config.py has no default bearer token; the app refuses to start without FILMRUNNER_API_BEARER_TOKEN outside development
  - index.html renders every API string via textContent or an escape helper; a test injects `<img onerror>` into a schedule item and asserts it is shown as text
  - audit fields (created_by, published_at) are set server-side from the authenticated caller and the clock, never from the request body; a test sends spoofed values and asserts they are ignored
  - failure case: if a fix would break the offline cache format, the PR says so and bumps the cache version instead of silently changing shape
